      <h1> About Taiwan </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        Taiwan is an island nation located in East Asia, just off the southeastern coast of China. It's known for its stunning natural landscapes, rich cultural heritage, technological advancements, and complex political status. During the late 17th century China ruled over Taiwan for around 2 centuries before Japan acquired Taiwan in 1895. Following this was the Sino-Japanese War, a major conflict during WW2 that led to Taiwan becoming a colony. Then in 1945, Taiwan was returned to Nationalist Chinese control following Japan's defeat in WW2.
