          In Taiwan there is a tradition where Taiwanese people serve a lot of food to their guest but doesn't expect them to finish all of it. If the guest does somehow finish and leave an empty bowl, it means that they didn't serve enough food and the guests are still hungry. Although in may other counties, an empty bowl may mean that the guests appreciate your cooking and that your cooking was good but in Taiwan it means that the people didn't serve their guests well enough.

          The Lantern Festival is a celebration of the coming of spring. It's also the first day of the new year where there's a full moon. The history of this festival dates back to the Qing dynasty. A group of villagers would go to the mountains during the winter to avoid having to deal with bandits, when the worst of the winter has passed, sky lanterns were flown up as a signal saying that it was safe in the village now. The lanterns were also thought to be able to remove bad luck and make your wishes come true.
