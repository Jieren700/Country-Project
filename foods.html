          Taiwan dumplings also known as Xiao Long Bao is similar to a bun with meat wrapped inside. Though there is a very big difference between them, their structure is very similar. On the outside, the skin is made up of a thin layer of special dough made from flour while the inside is made of some sort of fatty meat, mostly it's pork. Then they are placed into a small bamboo steamer to be steamed. When steaming, the dumplings release a fragrant soup that explodes in your mouth when you eat it.
